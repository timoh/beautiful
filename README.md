Le Beautiful board
=========

Maximizing Dopamine in Task Management since 2014

-------------

**Summary**: 

The beautiful board project got started on a sunny spring day in Espoo, Finland. The idea was simple, how can we make the digital Kanban board as interactive as the physical board? But we don’t want to stop there, the goal is to make it so good that it can increase the quality, efficiency and motivation of the whole team & its efforts. The beautiful board should do what a personal trainer does, or the reason for why Crossfit classes are so popular, motivate you and push you forward to do stuff you didn’t think were possible. In short, push you to do great stuff. 

The main issues that we identified during the start of the project were:

1.	Splitting stories
2.	The visibility of the “big picture”
3.	Importance of visible progress (bragging rights)

---------------

Let’s start with **splitting stories**, we’ve all been there, it’s the end of the sprint and we haven’t even finished half of the planned scope. It’s not an ideal situation for anyone in the team, not being able to complete what you planned is toxic and doesn’t do any good. Often the problem is that you tend to be over optimistic about how much you can get done and end up putting to much stuff into the sprint. One solution to avoid this is to make it easier, natural and super visible to split stories into smaller tasks. Our assumption is that it enables you to better estimate the size of the task and let you move stuff to “Done” more often. Getting stuff done feels good, so you’ll want to do that as often as possible, and when you do get stuff to done it helps seeing the “big picture” which brings us to the next point. 


The **“big picture”**, when we brainstormed about how we could improve the Kanban board our conclusion was that what it really comes down to is to make work rewarding and motivating for people using the board. This is done partly by adding structure to the work of the team but another big factor is visibility. Right now the Kanban board is pretty good at visualizing what everyone is doing but it dosen’t do a very good job at putting that work into perspective. It does a poor job at communicating “why” you are doing this and what your task is related to, why does it matter? The way we tackle it in the UVP is that we show a “big picture” under the board, this picture lights up when a task is chosen. The aim is to show everyone in the team how the particular task is related to what your building. We also feel that it should act as a reminder for the team to focus on getting shit done. It’s both feels better and is better for business to complete & ship one epic than it is to get 10% done of 10 epics. It’s may seem obvious and simple but somehow we humans still often manage to mess it up so we felt that some additional help here might not be such a bad idea. ☺ 

Last but not least, and very related to the two other points, **visible progress**. Say Imagine that you’re a person who’s never run before and then you decide to run a marathon, how do you achieve it? You split it! You start by running a mile, you time yourself and you do it again and guess what chances are you did it faster this time! Then you repeat, add miles, and enjoy the progress your doing until one day you cross the finish line of your first marathon. We’re not saying it’s easy but it’s a lot easier if you get to enjoy the journey by seeing the progress that you making one jog at a time. The same logic is true with work, you set a goal with the team of something that you aim to achieve. You break it down into smaller pieces and start your journey towards our goal one step at a time. Now the difference here compared to the marathon is that your now in a team. But that’s a wonderful thing because now you’re not alone, you’re in a team. One of the reasons we believe that many people prefer a physical board over a digital is the joy of moving your task to done in front of the team. Let’s admit it, it feels good and it should, you’ve completed your task, boom. But this feeling is not as strong if you do it by yourself on a digital screen and the change is already present when you do your daily with the rest of the team. The Beautiful board aims to fix this by showing the progress of the last 24H on an activity feed next to the screen, showing everything you’ve done, not just completed tasks but tasks you’ve started commented on and even pictures of cats that you’ve posted to the feed. ☺ In addition you can use the mobile version of the board to update your tasks in real-time and presumably get to enjoy the good feeling of moving your task in front of the team. 

**Ending note**:

This is what we’ve done and come up with so far, it’s far from done but you probably get the idea of what we’re trying to do here. We’d also love to add the whole rotation of a product/feature to the process, from idea and initial assumption to a shipped product until it comes back to the backlog for improvements. The point here would be to increase the learning, ship better products and as an end goal, to make every day work more fun & motivating for everyone involved. 

If you find any of this resonates to you please share your thoughts, develop the board further or be in touch! ☺
